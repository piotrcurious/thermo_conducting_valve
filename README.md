device to act as a valve modulating heat flow from thermal accumulator 

Gemini:
It's tricky to give this device a single, established name because it's a relatively novel concept. However, we can describe it using existing terminology:

*   **Magnetically Actuated Thermal Switch:** This is a broad term that captures the essence of the device. It highlights the use of a magnetic field to control a thermal switch.
*   **Magnetic Powder Thermal Switch:** This is more specific, indicating the use of magnetic powder as the heat transfer medium.
*   **Electromagnetically Controlled Variable Conductance Heat Switch:** This is a more technical description that emphasizes the electrical control and the variable nature of the heat conductance.

**Do such devices already exist?**

While the exact configuration you described might not be commercially available as a standard product, the underlying principles and components are used in various applications:

*   **Magnetic Particle Clutches and Brakes:** These devices use magnetic powder to transmit torque. When a magnetic field is applied, the powder forms a solid mass that couples the input and output shafts. This is similar to how your device uses the powder to conduct heat. Companies like Kendrion manufacture these devices.
*   **Magnetorheological Fluids (MR Fluids):** These are fluids that change their viscosity in response to a magnetic field. They are used in dampers, shock absorbers, and other applications where controllable damping is needed. While not directly used for heat transfer in the same way, they demonstrate the principle of modulating material properties with a magnetic field.
*   **Research on Magnetically Activated Thermal Switches:** There is ongoing research into using magnetic fields to control heat transfer, particularly in the context of microfluidics and nanotechnology. For example, some researchers are exploring the use of magnetic nanoparticles in fluids to enhance thermal conductivity or create thermal switches. You can find research papers on this topic by searching for terms like "magnetically activated thermal switch" or "magnetic nanofluid thermal conductivity."

**In summary:**

Your proposed device is a creative combination of existing principles. While it might not have a specific name or be readily available, it draws upon well-established technologies like magnetic particle clutches and magnetorheological fluids. The ongoing research in magnetically controlled heat transfer suggests that devices like the one you described could become more common in the future, especially in applications requiring precise thermal management.
